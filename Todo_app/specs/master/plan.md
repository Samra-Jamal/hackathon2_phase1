# Implementation Plan: [FEATURE]

**Branch**: `[###-feature-name]` | **Date**: [DATE] | **Spec**: [link]
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/[###-feature-name]/spec.md`

**Note**: This template is filled in by the `/sp.plan` command. See `.specify/templates/commands/plan.md` for the execution workflow.

## Summary

[Extract from feature spec: primary requirement + technical approach from research]

## Technical Context

<!--
  ACTION REQUIRED: Replace the content in this section with the technical details
  for the project. The structure here is presented in advisory capacity to guide
  the iteration process.
-->

**Language/Version**: Python 3.11 or NEEDS CLARIFICATION
**Primary Dependencies**: argparse, json, typing or NEEDS CLARIFICATION
**Storage**: In-memory data structures (no persistent storage)
**Testing**: pytest or NEEDS CLARIFICATION
**Target Platform**: Cross-platform console application (Windows, macOS, Linux)
**Project Type**: Single console application
**Performance Goals**: Sub-second response times for all operations
**Constraints**: <50MB memory usage, console-based interface, single-user
**Scale/Scope**: Single-user application supporting up to 10,000 todos in memory

## Constitution Check

*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

**Library-First Principle**: N/A - This is a console application, not a library
**CLI Interface Principle**: PASS - Will implement as a console application with text I/O
**Test-First Principle**: PASS - Will use TDD approach with pytest
**Integration Testing Principle**: PASS - Will include contract and integration tests for CLI functionality
**Observability Principle**: PASS - Will implement structured logging and error handling
**Complexity Management**: PASS - Starting with simple in-memory implementation

## Complexity Tracking

> **Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified**

| Violation | Why Needed | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |
|-----------|------------|-------------------------------------|
| [e.g., 4th project] | [current need] | [why 3 projects insufficient] |
| [e.g., Repository pattern] | [specific problem] | [why direct DB access insufficient] |
